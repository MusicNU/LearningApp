We position our work as inclusive, in that we endeavor to address historic and contemporary disparities in inclusivity and social, racial and economic inequity. Furthermore, we work with teachers, students, community members and parents, in hope of supporting the development of positive learning ecosystems."
    const aboutText2 = "MusicNU is a TIILT project with the objective of changing music theory education for students by employing non-classical songs as a teaching tool. It is an interactive website that takes a chosen song from a user, analyzes the songâ€™s chord makeup, melody, rhythm, tempo, key, and other features, and transforms it into a visual display to help students learn about the music theory of a song in a fun, visual, and accessible way. Through this project, we hope to bridge the gap between traditional music theory education and contemporary music preferences, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of diverse musical genres among students."
